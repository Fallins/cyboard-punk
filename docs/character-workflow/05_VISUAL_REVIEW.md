```

## Review rules

- Use the smallest evidence set that proves the issue, but include all required gate views.
- Scores without written evidence are not sufficient for a FAIL or PASS.
- A PASS with an unresolved P0/P1 issue is invalid.
- If the user rejects an output, record the gate as FAIL regardless of the agent's score.
- If a frozen area changes, record the regression and reopen the affected earlier gate.
